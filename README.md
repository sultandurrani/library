# library
This project is a library checkout system. First, it asks the user to log in or sign up. The program then presents the user with a list of books to check out. The user can check out any book, available in inventory, for two weeks. When returning a book, the program will charge an appropriate late fee if the user had the book for longer than two weeks (for demonstration purposes it charges $10 per 10 real-time seconds passed). The program also keeps a track of the number of copies available for each book, incrementing or decrementing the inventory count if a customer checks out or returns a book respectively.
