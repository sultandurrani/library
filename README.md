# library
This program is a library checkout system. Firstly, it asks the user to log in or sign up. The program then presents the user with a  list of books to check out. The user can check out any book in inventory for two weeks. When returning a book, the program will charge an appropriate late fee if the user had the book for longer than two week (for demonstration purposes it charges $10 per 10 seconds passed). The program also keeps a track of number of copies available for each book, incrementing or decrementing the inventory count if a customer checks out or returns a book respectively.
